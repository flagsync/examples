# JavaScript SDK Demo

This is a demo React app showcasing the [@flagsync/js-sdk](https://github.com/flagsync/js-sdk) for feature flag usage.

## âœ¨ Features

- Type-safe flag evaluation with the `flag` function
- Real-time flag updates
- SDK configuration options
- Debug logging

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. Add your FlagSync SDK key to `.env`:
   ```dotenv
   VITE_FLAGSYNC_SDK_KEY=your-key-here
   ```
   > To find this, navigate to the desired workspace environment from the [Dashboard](https://www.flagsync.com/dashboard/settings/organization/workspaces/). Be sure to use a client-side SDK key.
2. Install dependencies and start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Update the flag key in `main.ts` to the flag you want to test:
   ```tsx
   const isEnabled = client.flag('my-first-kill-switch');
   ```
4. Visit [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to see the flag value and try out the examples.
5. Toggle the flag in the [Flags Dashboard](https://www.flagsync.com/dashboard/flags/) and see real-time updates in the app on refresh.

## ðŸ”§ Example Usage

```tsx
const isEnabled = client.flag('my-first-kill-switch');
```
